// Null: It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript. Undefined: It means the value does not exist in the compiler.


// 6. What are various operators supported by javascript?
// Assignment Operators, Arithmetic Operators, Comparison Operators, Logical Operators, Bitwise Operators, String Operators, Other Operators


// 7. What is 'typeof' operator?
// Typeof in JavaScript is an operator used for type checking and returns the data type of the operand passed to it. The operand can be any variable, function, or object whose type you want to find out using the typeof operator.


//8. What are some of the important features of JavaScript ES6
//let and const Keywords, Arrow Functions, Multi-line Strings, Default Parameters, Template Literals, Destructuring Assignment, Enhanced Object Literals, Promises, Classes, Modules


//9. How does the ternary operator in javascript work?
//The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark ( ? ), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : ), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.


//10. What are valid variable names in js?
//Name, Age, Gender, and So on


//11. What is variable scope?

//12. What is variable assignment?

// NUMBERS

// 1. How do you generate random integers in js?

// 2. What is isNaN?
// Is not a number


// 3. How to do you see if a number is even?

// 4. how do you convert the string '1' to the number 1



// STRINGS



//1. Explain these methods

// toLowerCase()
// The toLowerCase() method converts a string to lowercase letters.
